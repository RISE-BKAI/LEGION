Welcome to the source code repo of **AutoPruner**, a LLM-based call graph pruning tool introduced in our paper "AutoPruner: Transformer-based Call Graph Pruning"! 


## üìÉ Overview
If you are interested in our work, please refer to our [overview](https://github.com/soarsmu/AutoPruner/blob/main/overview.md) for more details.

## üèÅ Repository Organization
The structure of our source code's repository is as follows:
- config: contains our experimental configurations;
- script: contains script for running our experiments;
- src: contains our source code.
    - finetune: contains source code for fine-tuning phase
    - training: contains  source code for training phase
    - utils: contains source code for utility functions, e.g., logger, visualization, ...
    - gnn: contains source code for gnn benchmark
    - Note that, for each sub-folder in this folder, main.py, dataset.py, model.py contains the source code of training/testing, dataset processing and deep learning models, respectively;
- environment.yml: contains the configuration for AutoPruner's enviroment. 

The structure of our data's repository is as follows:

- dl_dataset: contains our processed dataset for AutoPruner;
- gnn_dataset: contains our processed dataset for GNN benchmark;
- gnn_model: contains our trained models for GNN benchmarks;
- info_data: contains the lists of training and testing programs;
- model: contains our trained models for AutoPruner;
- npe_result: contains the results of manual evaluation for Null-pointer analysis;
- processed_data: contains extracted source code for methods in programs in [cgPruner's dataset](https://zenodo.org/record/5806537)
- raw_data: contains the static call graphs generated by static analysis tools from [cgPruner](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~akshayutture/papers/icse22_firstPaper_preprint.pdf)

## üîß Installations

### Requirements
#### Hardware
- More than 200GB disk space
- 2 NVIDIA GPU that CUDA 11.3; supports and have at least 8GB memory.
#### Software
- Ubuntu 18.04 or newer
- Docker/Conda
 
### Environment Configuration
#### Conda
```
conda env create -n autopruner --file environment.yml
```

#### Docker
For ease of use, we also provide a 
installation package via a [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/thanhlecong/autopruner). User can setup AutoPruner's docker step-by-step as follows:

- Pull AutoPruner's docker image: 
```
docker pull thanhlecong/autopruner:v2
```
- Run a docker container:
```
docker run --name autopruner -it --shm-size 16G --gpus all thanhlecong/autopruner:v2
```
- Activate conda:
```
source /opt/conda/bin/activate
```
- Activate AutoPruner's conda enviroment: 
```
conda activate autopruner
```
Note that, the source code of AutoPruner are stored at /workspace/ in Docker. So, please move to this folder before running experiments. 


## üöÄ Usage
To use our tool, please use the following command
```
python3 -m src.training.main --config_path [config path]
                             --mode [mode: test or train] 
                             --feature [type of features: 0: structure, 1: semantic, 2:combine] 
                             --model_path [path to saved model (for saving in train mode and loading in test mode)]
```
## üìÅ Artifact

To replicate the result of AutoPruner, please down the data from our [replication package](https://zenodo.org/record/6369874#.YjWzmi8RppR) and put in the same folder with this repository, then run following below instructions. Note that, our results may be slightly different when running on different devices. However, this diffences does not affect our findings in the paper. 


### RQ1
To replicate the result of AutoPruner in call graph pruning on Wala (RQ1), please use
```
bash script/rq1_wala.sh
```
To replicate the result of AutoPruner in call graph pruning on Doop (RQ1), please use
```
bash script/rq1_doop.sh
```
To replicate the result of AutoPruner in call graph pruning on Petablox (RQ1), please use
```
bash script/rq1_peta.sh
```

### RQ2
#### Null-pointer Analysis
In this analysis, we follow the experimental settings of [cgPruner](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~akshayutture/papers/icse22_firstPaper_preprint.pdf) including their code of Null-pointer Analysis (NPA). Please refer to cgPruner's [replication package](https://zenodo.org/record/6057691#.YoXA8WBByek) for further instructions. You also can find our manual evaluation in npe_result folder in this [link](https://zenodo.org/record/6369874#.YjWzmi8RppR)
